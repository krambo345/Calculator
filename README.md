# Calculator
[Calculator](https://krambo345.github.io/Calculator/)  
A practice for API's and Front-end programming.  
Hey everyone! This is the first repository I'm releasing on GitHub, so it's kinda exciting! This was just some practice to keep my skills sharp and fresh.  

# API's
Free packages from ipinfo.io and weatherapi.com were used in this project.  
I used ipinfo.io to get location information, and plugged that in to weatherapi.com to automatically detect weather in your area!  
NONE of the location information is stored in any way.  

# Final Thoughts
I think the project turned out pretty good CSS wise. I'll work on trying to make it more responsive as it looks good only on desktop. And the Javascript for calculations does work, but there are issues with certain orders of operations.  
I want to improve! So I'd appreicate any feedback!
